## request
1. there are a lot of public data in financial domain, such as price, report, comments etc. Those data are very useful and powerful for data analyst and researchers. but before them can mine the value from data, they must do a lot data preparation such as data clean, etl etc. and those preparation are very similar even same at financial domain. so this is a big waste for financial data analysts, researchers even investors.
1. most financial data are semi-structed, and very boring and hard for investors to read and understand. individual investors need an ai agent to talk and ask about all the financial and stock information they want to know
1. in the future a lot financial service commpanies will operate an ai agent for his clients. so they will do massive same text embedding computing and store the embedding results for future query. so if there are a public embedding big database or data warehouse, will save a lot computing and CO2.
## target
1. first class target:
create ai agent of finnacial domain,that can analyse finnacial tabular data and multimodal report such as text, pic etc.
so every people can use natural language to talk the ai agent named JIUCAI to get finnacial information and insight, and exchange decisions by JIUCAI

1. copilot for financial analysts
